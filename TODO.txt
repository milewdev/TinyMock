Extract all error messages and make sure they are consistent.
Ensure that we use should.respondTo in unit tests to check for existence of methods on an object.
Check the ordering of the unit tests - are they listed logically?
Search for 'signature' in code and tests and replace with 'expectation' as appropriate.
Check that spacing around '(' and ')' is consistent.
Ensure that all 'private' attributes have a leading underscore (e.g. _name).
Ensure that all 'throws' statements throw Error's, not Strings, etc.
Use either the word 'exception' or the work 'error' (pick one and be consistent).
Extract all test descriptions and make sure they are consistent.
Remove 'expectations' attribute from mocked objects.
Ensure that all test descriptions are sentence parts, not capitalized sentences.
Write a test for mock-within-mock.
Add mock() parameters: name of 'expects' method, number of convenience mock objects to create.
Add comments showing progression of algorithm (e.g. show changes to arrays or a parameter).
Extract messages (e.g. error messages) into a separate JSON (?) file.
