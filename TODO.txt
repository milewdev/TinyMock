Extract all error messages and make sure they are consistent.
Ensure that we use should.respondTo in unit tests to check for existence of methods on an object.
Check the ordering of the unit tests - are they listed logically?
Search for 'signature' in code and tests and replace with 'expectation' as appropriate.
Check that spacing around '(' and ')' is consistent.
Ensure that all 'private' attributes have a leading underscore (e.g. _name).
